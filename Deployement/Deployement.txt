# Deployment: 

- A Deployment manages a set of Pods to run an application workload, usually one that doesn't maintain state.
- A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets(Replicaset ensure that specified number of pod replica running at one time )
- Deployment will create the ReplicaSets which is kubernetes controller which handling the auto healing feature of the pod
- Deployment ---> ReplicaSets ----> pod
- Deployment will create ReplicaSets and Replicasets will create the pod
- A Deployment is a high-level object in Kubernetes that:
1.   Manages replica sets and pods	
2.   Ensures the desired number of identical Pods are always running
3. Supports rolling updates, rollbacks, and self-healing

- 

## Example:

![](/home/ravi/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2025-07-02 23-37-23.png)

When delete the one pod manually or due some issue pod will created immediately. You can see in the below image 

![](/home/ravi/Pictures/Screenshots/autoHealing.png)



Example With replicasets as 3 (Meaning running 3 pods ). I deleted one pod manually and it will created automatically by feature called **Auto healing** --> Like Zero down disturbance
