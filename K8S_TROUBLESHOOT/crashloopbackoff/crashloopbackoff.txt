# CrashLoopBackOff



When you see "CrashLoopBackOff," it means that kubelet is trying to run the container, but it keeps failing and crashing. After crashing, Kubernetes tries to restart the container automatically, but if the container keeps failing repeatedly, you end up in a loop of crashes and restarts, thus the term "CrashLoopBackOff."

This situation indicates that something is wrong with the application or the configuration that needs to be fixed.

## Common Situations of CrashLoopBackOff



The CrashLoopBackOff error in Kubernetes indicates that a container is repeatedly crashing and restarting. Here are explanations of how the CrashLoopBackOff error can occur due to the specific reasons you listed:

### Misconfigurations



Misconfigurations can encompass a wide range of issues, from incorrect environment variables to improper setup of service ports or volumes. These misconfigurations can prevent the application from starting correctly, leading to crashes. For example, if an application expects a certain environment variable to connect to a database and that variable is not set or is incorrect, the application might crash as it cannot establish a database connection.

### Errors in the Liveness Probes

Liveness probes in Kubernetes are used to check the health of a container. If a liveness probe is incorrectly configured, it might falsely report that the container is unhealthy, causing Kubernetes to kill and restart the container repeatedly. For example, if the liveness probe checks a URL or port that the application does not expose or checks too soon before the application is ready, the container will be repeatedly terminated and restarted.

### The Memory Limits Are Too Low

If the memory limits set for a container are too low, the application might exceed this limit, especially under load, leading to the container being killed by Kubernetes. This can happen repeatedly if the workload does not decrease, causing a cycle of crashing and restarting. Kubernetes uses these limits to ensure that containers do not consume all available resources on a node, which can affect other containers.

### Wrong Command Line Arguments![](/home/ravi/Pictures/Screenshots/crashloopbackoff_Wrong_cmd_in_Dockerfile.png)





Containers might be configured to start with specific command-line arguments. If these arguments are wrong or lead to the application exiting (for example, passing an invalid option to a command), the container will exit immediately. Kubernetes will then attempt to restart it, leading to the CrashLoopBackOff status. An example would be passing a configuration file path that does not exist or is inaccessible.

### Bugs & Exceptions



Bugs in the application code, such as unhandled exceptions or segmentation faults, can cause the application to crash. For instance, if the application tries to access a null pointer or fails to catch and handle an exception correctly, it might terminate unexpectedly. Kubernetes, detecting the crash, will restart the container, but if the bug is triggered each time the application runs, this leads to a repetitive crash loop.

------







In Kubernetes, **liveness probes** (often referred to as `liveprobe` informally) are used to check if a container inside a pod is **still running and healthy**. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will **restart the container**.

### üîç What is a Liveness Probe?

A **liveness probe** checks whether the application running inside the container is alive (i.e., not hung or deadlocked). It's useful for detecting and remedying situations where an application is running but not functioning properly.

------

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Liveness Probes Work:

- You define a probe in the pod specification using:
  - `httpGet`
  - `tcpSocket`
  - `exec`

Kubernetes will start checking after an optional initial delay and continue periodically.

------

### üß™ Types of Liveness Probes:

1. **HTTP GET Probe**:
    Sends an HTTP GET request to the container.

   ```
   yamlCopyEditlivenessProbe:
     httpGet:
       path: /health
       port: 8080
     initialDelaySeconds: 10
     periodSeconds: 5
   ```

2. **TCP Socket Probe**:
    Checks if the port is open.

   ```
   yamlCopyEditlivenessProbe:
     tcpSocket:
       port: 3306
     initialDelaySeconds: 15
     periodSeconds: 20
   ```

3. **Exec Command Probe**:
    Runs a command in the container. If the command exits with `0`, it's healthy.

   ```
   yamlCopyEditlivenessProbe:
     exec:
       command:
         - cat
         - /tmp/healthy
     initialDelaySeconds: 5
     periodSeconds: 10
   ```

### üß† Key Parameters:

| Parameter             | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Delay before starting the first probe.                    |
| `periodSeconds`       | Time between successive probes.                           |
| `timeoutSeconds`      | Timeout for the probe to complete.                        |
| `failureThreshold`    | How many failures before the container is restarted.      |
| `successThreshold`    | (Mainly used with readiness) How many successes to be OK. |



### ‚úÖ 1. **Readiness Probe**

**Purpose**: Checks if the container is **ready to accept traffic**.

- If the readiness probe fails, **Kubernetes removes the pod from service** (e.g., it won't receive traffic from a Service).
- The container **is not restarted** when the readiness probe fails.

üìå Useful when:

- The app takes time to initialize.
- The app temporarily can't serve requests (e.g., doing heavy computations or waiting for a dependency).

```
yamlCopyEditreadinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

------

### üîÑ 2. **Startup Probe**

**Purpose**: Used to **check if the application has successfully started**.

- If the startup probe fails, Kubernetes **restarts the container**.
- While the startup probe is running, **liveness and readiness probes are disabled**.
- Once the startup probe succeeds, liveness and readiness take over.

üìå Useful when:

- Applications **take a long time to boot up**, especially Java or Spring Boot apps.
- Prevents false failures of liveness probe during startup.

```
yamlCopyEditstartupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

------

### üß© Summary Table:

| **Probe Type**   | **What it checks**                 | **Failure Effect**                 | **Use Case**                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `livenessProbe`  | Is the app still healthy?          | Container is restarted             | App hung, memory leak, deadlock                  |
| `readinessProbe` | Is the app ready to serve traffic? | Pod removed from Service endpoints | Slow initialization, temporarily unavailable app |
| `startupProbe`   | Has the app finished starting up?  | Container is restarted             | Long boot time apps like Spring Boot, JVM apps   |

what are these called in k8s?



###### ChatGPT said:

In Kubernetes, these are officially called **Probes** and are part of the **container lifecycle management**.

### üìõ Official Names in Kubernetes:

| **Common Term**     | **Kubernetes Field Name (in YAML)** | **Purpose**                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Liveness Probe**  | `livenessProbe`                     | Check if container is healthy (restart if not) |
| **Readiness Probe** | `readinessProbe`                    | Check if container is ready to serve traffic   |
| **Startup Probe**   | `startupProbe`                      | Check if app has started up completely         |



------

### üìÅ Where Are They Defined?

All probes are defined under the `containers:` section of a Pod or Deployment spec in YAML.

Example structure:

```
yamlCopyEditspec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: myapp:latest
      livenessProbe: {...}
      readinessProbe: {...}
      startupProbe: {...}
```

------

### üõ†Ô∏è Internally, Kubernetes uses:

- These fields to configure **kubelet** (the agent running on each node) to periodically **run health checks** on containers.
- Based on the result, it may:
  - Restart the container (for `livenessProbe` or `startupProbe`)
  - Remove it from the service endpoint list (for `readinessProbe`)
